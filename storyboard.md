# Goal

Fascinate people about asteroids and indicate how ascavis helps to study them.


# Tasks

- Ute's friend: animations & cutting
- Katja: voice-over
- Eduard: storyboard & science
- Tobias: machine learning


# General notes

- imho the interview are largely unusable because of bad sound quality and the
  improvised nature of the text.
- Storyboard uses lots of (hopefully) publically available imagery/video
  footage that has to be obtained.
- The website is still missing the page 'More about astroids' - maybe we can coordinate with the science here.


# Storyboard

- Logo
    - Animated Ascavis project logo
    - Subtitle: Helping to understand asteroids
	- Hackathon date and logo, lab75 logo?, Ascavis ausschreiben?
- Asteroids
    - Image/Video: asteroid flies by, hover over asteroid photo (Rosetta?)
    - Voice: Our solar system harbours millions of asteroids.
- Planet formation
    - Image/Video: some picture of the planet formation/early solar system
    - Voice: Asteroids are the remnant debris of the planet formation processes
      in the early solar system. They have affected Earth's evolution in the
      past and will continue to do so in the future.
- Asteroid mining
    - Image/Video: asteroid (ideally some mining operations)
    - Voice: Asteroid mining could have a profound economical impact on both
      space travel and life on Earth.
- Lack of categorization
    - Video: Team working (incl. view on web app)
    - Voice: Yet only a fraction of asteroids have been successfully
      categorized. This is why our team tackled the challenge to study
      asteroids using machine learning techniques for the 2015 NASA
      SpaceAppsChallenge.
- Spitzer & WISE
    - Image: in sequence Spitzer, WISE space telescopes
    - Voice: From space missions such as Spitzer and WISE, data about asteroids
      is already publicly available.
- Data acquisition
    - Video: Team from outside interview/discussing (show UI / someone using it?)
    - Voice: Ascavis brings this data together and makes it accessible for
      everyone.
- Hobby astronomers
    - Video: People working on computer
    - Voice: Our goal is to eventually use all this data to learn more about
      yet unknown asteroids.
- Conclusion
    - Video: Asteroid field, solar system or similar
    - Voice: Ascavis will enable a much clearer overview of our immediate
      planetary neighbourhood and expand our horizon.
- Logo again
    - Image: Logo
    - Voice: Ascavis. (and some catch-phrase or sound effect or whatever)

# What I miss (Katja)
The UI is not shown, or did I miss something?
Bin nicht sicher, ob 
'Our goal is to eventually use all this data to learn more about yet unknown asteroids.' 
stimmt..?
Ansonsten, guter Text. :)
