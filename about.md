Our project aims to bring light into the darkness of the vast amounts of
unclassified asteroid data. In the next step, we prepare our data in a web
service that visualizes our findings. The idea is on one hand to support
scientists with our generated data and on the other to provide a tool for
amateurs that opens up the field of asteroid science for them in an explorative
way via visually browsing our web app.
