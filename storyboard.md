# Goal

Fascinate people about asteroids and indicate how ascavis helps to study them.


# Tasks

- Ute's friend: animations & cutting
- Katja: voice-over
- Eduard: storyboard & science
- Tobias: machine learning


# General notes

- imho the interview are largely unusable because of bad sound quality and the
  improvised nature of the text.
- Storyboard uses lots of (hopefully) publically available imagery/video
  footage that has to be obtained.


# Storyboard

- Logo
    - Animated Ascavis project logo
    - Subtitle: Helping to understand asteroids
- Asteroids
    - Image/Video: asteroid flies by, hover over asteroid photo (Rosetta?)
    - Voice: Our solar system harbours millions of asteroids. On first sight an
      asteroid might just be a pile of rock in space.
- Team discovering stuff
    - Video: People looking at screens, i.e. discovering
    - Voice: But if you look closer, there's much more to discover.
- Planet formation
    - Image/Video: some picture of the planet formation/early solar system
    - Voice: Asteroids are the remnant debris of the planet formation processes
      in the early solar system. They have affected Earth's evolution in the
      past and will continue to do so in the future. This makes them
      interesting objects for scientific research.
- Asteroid mining
    - Image/Video: asteroid (ideally some mining operations)
    - Voice: Many of them are very rich in minerals. A few companies have
      already begun to plan mining operations on asteroids in near-Earth orbit.
      Asteroid mining could have a profound economical impact on both space
      travel and life on Earth.
- Hazardous objects
    - Image/Video: catastrophic impact or the threat of one
    - Voice: However, asteroids also pose a potential threat for humanity.
      There is a remote possibility that a large asteroid impacts Earth with
      devastating consequences.
- Lack of categorization
    - Video: Team working (incl. view on web app)
    - Voice: Yet only a fraction of asteroids have been successfully
      categorized. This is why our team tackled the challenge to study
      asteroids using machine learning techniques for the 2015 NASA
      SpaceAppsChallenge.
- Spitzer & WISE
    - Image: in sequence Spitzer, WISE space telescopes
    - Voice: From space missions such as Spitzer and WISE data about asteroids
      is already publically available.
- Data acquisition
    - Video: Team from outside interview/discussing
    - Voice: Ascavis brings this data together and makes it accessible for
      everyone.
- Hobby astronomers
    - Video: People working on computer
    - Voice: Hobby astronomers also contribute valuable observational data.
      Our goal is to eventually use all this data to learn more about
      yet unknown asteroids.
- Machine learning
    - Video: Other working video
    - Voice: Machine learning allows us to automate this process by training an
      algorithm to characterise these asteroids for us.
- Conclusion
    - Video: Asteroid field, solar system or similar
    - Voice: Ascavis will enable a much clearer overview of our immediate
      planetary neighbourhood and expand our horizon.
- Logo again
    - Image: Logo
    - Voice: Ascavis. (and some catch-phrase or sound effect or whatever)
